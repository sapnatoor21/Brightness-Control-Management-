Brightness Control with Hand Detection 

Developed a brightness control system utilizing hand detection technology to automatically adjust screen brightness based on hand proximity. Integrated real-time computer vision algorithms for accurate hand tracking using a camera module. Enhanced user experience through an intuitive interface, allowing for manual overrides and customizable settings. Improved energy efficiency by reducing power consumption in the absence of user presence. Successfully implemented on a Raspberry Pi platform with OpenCV for hand detection and brightness adjustment.
